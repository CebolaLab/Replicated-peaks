# Replicated-peaks

This Github contains a short guide to defining replicated peaks from the output of macs2.

Replicated peaks are defined as peaks present in the *pooled* analysis and which are independently called in *two or more* biological replicates. 


The files required for this analysis include:

- macs2 pooled peaks
- macs2 peaks for individual samples

Please see the previous tutorials https://github.com/CebolaLab/ATAC-seq and https://github.com/CebolaLab/ChIPmentation for instructions on how to generate these files.
